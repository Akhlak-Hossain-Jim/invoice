# Invoicing Front-end App
[Invoicing](https://invoice-jim.netlify.app/) is a Front-end Web APP dedicated to Shuvro Jaya.

# Quickstart

## Installation

### In Chrome 
It's too easy to install in Google Chrome:

  * First, go to this [Link](https://invoice-jim.netlify.app/).
  * Just click on the Address bar and You can see the Installation option, click on it and you are ready to go.

## User Guide

 * You will Find Your new Installed App on your Screen or
   * Pressing Windows Button (On Windows Machine)
   * Pressing Show Applications (On Linux Machine)
   * Sorry I never used an Apple Machine. So I can say.
 * Open your app
   * You will see two Invoicing forms inherently
   * If you need more (which you will) just click ADD button below the form.
 * Fill up the form one by one (Left to Right)
 * ADD as much form as you need 
 * ~~exit the window or app~~ Don't you dare do that. Why? Well, nothing you just have to do everything all over again.
 * After You have done enough, Press `Ctrl` + `P`
 * You will see a Print Options Page poped up
 * Must Select Layout Option As "Landscape" 
 * You will see two Form per page orientation (this is How it work)
 * Hit save to save the document as a PDF file
 * Now you are free to exit.

Now it's your turn to Print or anything you need to do.

## Issue 

 * As it is an only front-end app it won't save any work inherently. 
 * Without saving the work exiting or refreshing the Browser or App your work will lose.
